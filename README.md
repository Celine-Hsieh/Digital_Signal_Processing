 Digital Singnal Processing Practice

An understanding of the underlying mechanisms and the limitations of basic digital signal processing methods is essential for the design of more complex algorithms.
The present notebooks cover fundamental aspects of digital signal processing. A focus is laid on a detailed mathematical treatise. The discussion of the mathematical background is important to understand the underlying principles in a more general manner. The materials contain computational examples and exercises to interpret the theoretical findings and foster understanding. The examples are designed to be explored in an interactive manner. Furthermore, an outlook to practical applications is given whenever possible.

The material covers the following topics

 * spectral analysis of deterministic signals
 * random signals and linear-time invariant systems
 * spectral estimation for random signals
 * realization of non-recursive and recursive filters
 * design of digital filters
