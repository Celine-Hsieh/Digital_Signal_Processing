# Digital_Signal_Processing

An understanding of the underlying mechanisms and the limitations of basic digital signal processing methods is essential for the design of more complex algorithms. The present notebooks cover fundamental aspects of digital signal processing. The discussion of the mathematical background is important to understand the underlying principles in a more general manner. The materials contain computational examples and exercises to be explored in an interactive manner. Furthermore, an outlook to practical applications is given whenever possible.

The material covers the following topics

 * Average Filter (https://github.com/celinehsieh68/Digital_Signal_Processing/tree/main/Average%20Filter)
 * Z_transform (https://github.com/celinehsieh68/Digital_Signal_Processing/tree/main/z_transform)
